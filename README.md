## History

Built with Elm is a generous project that was started by
[Luke Westby](https://github.com/lukewestby), in early
[December 2015](https://github.com/lukewestby/builtwithelm/commit/bc05fa3515604fd0aab05aeed351aedfb9cbb6dc),
with the intention to showcase the awesome work of the Elm community. He wanted
to create a place for people to have their work recognized and for their work
to stand as examples for those who are new to the language.

It was then graciously maintained by [Pavan Rikhi](https://github.com/prikhi)
as an [elm-community](https://github.com/elm-community) project for a few years
before active development waned.

In 2021, [Dwayne Crooks](https://github.com/dwayne) started showing interest in
the project and contributed a number of significant improvements which led to
him taking it over.
